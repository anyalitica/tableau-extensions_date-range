# tableau-extensions_date-range

This is a code for Tableau extension that automatically updates a date range filter to a lower bound of one year ago, and an upper bound of right now when the workbook is open.

I followed these step-by-step instructions from [Tableau's GitHub page](https://github.com/tableau/datadev-hackathon/wiki/Update-a-date-filter-to-a-specific-range).

Created as a part of the [Tableau #DataDev Mini-Challenges](https://www.tableau.com/developer/mini-challenges).
